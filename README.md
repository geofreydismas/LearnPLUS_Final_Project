## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learnplus.git
    cd learnplus
    ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Copy the `config.example.php` file to `config.php` and update the environment variables as necessary.
    ```php
    cp config.example.php config.php
    ```

    Update `config.php` with your database credentials and other configurations.
    
    ```php
    <?php
    return [
        'db' => [
            'host' => 'localhost',
            'dbname' => 'learnplus',
            'username' => 'your_db_username',
            'password' => 'your_db_password',
        ],
        // Other configurations
    ];
    ```

3. **Run Database Migrations:**
    Import the SQL file `database.sql` located in the `database` directory to set up the necessary tables in your database.

    ```bash
    mysql -u your_db_username -p your_db_password learnplus < database/database.sql
    ```

4. **Configure Web Server:**
    Ensure your web server points to the `public` directory of the LearnPlus application.

    For Apache, you can set up a virtual host:

    ```apache
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /path/to/learnplus/public
        ServerName learnplus.local

        <Directory /path/to/learnplus/public>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride All
            Require all granted
        </Directory>

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    </VirtualHost>
    ```

5. **Start the Web Server:**
